        <p>
            I started playing with computers when I was 10-years old, when I got an <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/atari400.html" target="_blank">Atari 400</a> for Christmas.
            I learned how to program in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_BASIC">Atari BASIC</a>, and quickly learned <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/6502_Assembly">6502 Assembler</a> so that I could squeeze every last bit of power out of that tiny 1.44 Mhz 6502 MOS processor!
        </p>
        <p>
            In high school and college, my computer programming hobby shifted to the world of PCs.  I learned object oriented Turbo Pascal and Turbo C++.  Of course, I also delved into high-performance graphics programming using 80x86 assember

        <p>
            During college, I fell into love with UNIX and later Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
            After college, my programming world has revolved around Java and JavaScript.   From time to time, I have played with other programming languages such as Go and Lua.

            Today, I spend most of my data on my Mac, on servers, and on the web.
