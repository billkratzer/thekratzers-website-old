## Penn State: 41, Villanova: 13

A noon kick-off on BTN.  Just what the doctored ordered after the College Game Day spectacle and prime-time kick last week.

I'm interested in seeing how well Villanova cornerback Christian Benford matches against Jahan Dotson.  Benford has four interceptions this year.  Can he snag one against Clifford?

On offense, I'm watching to see how running back Justin Covington does against a Penn State line that seems to have some problems against the running game.  With Covington averaging over 5 yards per carry, he could help Villanova sustain a few drives and create some noise early in the game.

I think Villanova could create a little havoc early in the game, but Penn State should take firm control by half-time.

## GO STATE!!!
