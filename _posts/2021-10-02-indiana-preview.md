## Good Guys: 24, Hoosiers: 21

I’ve been all over the place with this game.   

On one hand, I can see Michael Penix falling apart in a frenzied Beaver stadium against a hungry Penn State secondary and John Lovett igniting a previously dormant running game to a huge three touchdown win.   On the other hand, I can’t shake the bad feeling that the shine is really wearing off those wins against Wisconsin and Auburn.  A running game that can’t get started against a good Big Ten defense could spell disaster.

I’m falling in the middle now.   I think Penn State will look one dimensional but I also think Penix throws two picks that help Penn State get two desperately-needed touchdowns.   In the fourth quarter, Penn State goes for it on fourth and goal with Clifford getting in on a run to the sideline with a bad call by the refs.   Noah Cain runs the clock out on the last drive of the game.  

I hope Penn State wins by 21.   I don’t need that kind of excitement.

## GO STATE!
