## The losses sting. Even the meaningless ones.

Meaningless? Yes.

Remember, Penn State's path to the Big Ten Championship (and playoffs) remains unchanged - win out.   This was the path for Penn State before the Iowa game, and it still remains the path for Penn State after the game.

This is the beauty of a loss in a cross-over game.

Winning out guarantees winning the East and playing in the Big Ten Championship, where a very beatable Iowa will be your opponent.

There's some huge challenges ahead, but if Sean Clifford can get healthy enough to play (and play well), this will be a team to reckon with.  

##We ARE.
