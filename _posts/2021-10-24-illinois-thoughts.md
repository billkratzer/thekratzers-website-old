Let's focus on the positives of yesterday's game:

I enjoyed the new college football overtime!   This is the first time that I got to see the new format, and it was definitely entertaining.  I know detractors will cry foul and scream:  "but this isn't football!"   Screw it.  You've had 60 minutes of regulation and two overtimes to try to settle it the regular way.  Now it's time to have some fun!

That's it.

Regarding everything else: what a fucking mess.  A large squad of superior athletes got bested by a large squad of inferior athletes.

James Franklin and crew must have their eyes already on the sunny, warm weather of Los Angeles and the campus of USC.  It must have been visions of warm weather, sunny days, California gurls, Hollywood Starz, and cool beaches dancing around in the coaching staffs' heads as they tried to put on an appearance of preparing this team to play a football game.

To summarize:

1.  The offensive line got bullied by a 100+ ranked FBS defensive line.

2.  The defensive line got bullied by an offensive line that was publicly derided by head coach Brett Bielema earlier in the week.

3.  Four 4-star running backs seldom find any way to make positive yardage.

4.  Linebackers couldn't seam to tackle.

5.  The regression of tight-ends continue, when they aren't busy dropping passes they're not picking up their blocks.

6.  Your best quarterback option was Sean Clifford, who was playing like a wounded calf.

It's the coaches' job to get this team ready to play football games. It's pretty clear that this entire coaching staff gets a big "F" this week.

It will be interesting to see how this team responds.  Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, and Maryland ain't Illinois.

Tuesday's press conference should be fun.
