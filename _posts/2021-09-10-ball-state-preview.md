## Good Guys: 31, Ball State: 10

Everyone's calling this game a trap game, and for good reason.  Ball State was a top-performing Group of Five team last year and ended a top-25 team.  This year, they return 18 (18!) starters.

I can definitely see a slow start on Saturday (like Buffalo in 2019), but I think this group of Nittany Lions has way too much talent to let Ball State hang around for the entire game.

The interesting matchup will be veteran Ball State QB Drew Plitt and receiver Justin Hall versus the Penn State secondary.  I like our secondary in this match-up.

I'm interested to see how Penn State's offensive line and running game will perform.  Can the Nittany Lion rushing attack get some traction on Saturday?

Other things to watch:

1.  Jesse Luketa will be forced into the linebacker rotation for the first half because of Ellis Brooks' one-half suspension for the spearing penalty.  With Hakeem Beamon out, this starts to leave the defensive in thin shape.

2.  Hakeem Beamon is confirmed to be out.  No word yet on Keaton Ellis or John Lovett.

3.  Will Pinegar see some action for short kicks or will Jordan Stout shoulder the load for all kicking duties?

4.  Will we see more tight-end usage by Yurcich on Saturday?

I'm excited for more Penn State football.  I hope it lasts!

## GO STATE!
