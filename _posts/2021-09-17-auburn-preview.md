## Lions: 24, Tigers: 17

It's the third week of college football, and we have a third week of intrigue.

The Auburn Tigers come to Happy Valley Saturday night ranked 20ish in the country.  Auburn sports impressive margin-of-victories against the lesser foes of Akron and Alambama State, easily giving Auburn the weakest schedule strength so far in college football.

The difficulty ramps up dramatically as Auburn gets on the road, heads north, and gets to play in the blizzard known as the Penn State White Out.

Quite a difference, indeed.

All eyes are on Auburn Quarterback Bo Nix.  Nix has had an up and down career plagued by inconsistency.  While Nix has looked really good this year, let's remember that Akron and Alabama State are nothing like the Penn State defense he'll be facing on Saturday night.

At the end of the day, this seems like a game determined by mistakes.  Will Joey Porter Junior, Daquan Hardy, Jaquan Brisker, and Tariq Castro Fields feast on Nix on Saturday night?   Can the Auburn defense rattle Sean Clifford and force him to make some bad throws?

I think Penn State attempts to establish the run game, and has some success early on. I think Clifford remains comfortable enough in this game to win it.  If the Penn State secondary starts making plays, then this turns into a very long and ugly night for Auburn.

I can't wait.

## We ARE.
