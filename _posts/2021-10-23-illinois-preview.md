## Fighting Franklins: 24, Fighting Bielemas: 10.

Penn State fans will be watching the quarterback situation.  Sean Clifford started taking reps this week in practice, but I suspect the coaching staff will play it safe and hand the reigns over to Ta'Quan Roberson.  In a much more ideal starting situation, Roberson should have an opportunity to prove the casual Penn State football fan wrong after a tough situation in Iowa two weeks ago.

All eyes should be on former-quarterback-turned-wide-receiver Isiah Williams (no relation to the equally awesome Isiah "Juice" Williams).  Williams is a dynamic player that torched Penn State last year for over 100+ yards of rushing.   However, last years' defense isn't this years' defense.  It's going to be a really tall order for Williams to have a break-out day against this Nittany Lion defense.

Even without Sean Clifford and P.J. Mustipher, Penn State should still be way too much for Illinois to handle.

## WE ARE!
